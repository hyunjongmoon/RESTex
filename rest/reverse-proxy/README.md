This is the demo backend service for the light-proxy tutorial. It has one get endpoint and one post endpoint.

To generate the service use the following command line given you have light-codegen built locally in ~/networknt
working directory. Also it assumes that model-config and light-example-4j are in the same working directory. 

```

```
